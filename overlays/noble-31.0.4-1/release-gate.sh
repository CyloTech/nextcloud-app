# Release gate for repo.cylo.net/nextcloud:31.0.4-1, the deployed Ubuntu 24.04
# 'latest' image with only its php8.3 packages upgraded.
#
# Usage: ./release-gate.sh repo.cylo.net/nextcloud:31.0.4-1   (release)
#        ./release-gate.sh local/nextcloud-trial:31.0.4-1     (trial)
#
# Release mode requires the image to have been built with the php8.3 minimum
# pinned in the Dockerfile (ARG PHP83_MIN_VERSION). Trial mode accepts the
# minimum the trial image was built with (--build-arg PHP83_MIN_VERSION=<the
# current version>), so every other check can be exercised before Ubuntu
# publishes the fix. Release mode also requires every CVE id listed in
# release/required-fixes.txt to appear in the php8.3-common changelog; trial
# mode only reports them. Trial images are never pushed. Both modes require
# the release tag to be absent from the registry.
#
# Against the deployed base digest it checks: one added layer, identical
# runtime configuration (env including NEXTCLOUD_VER, command, ports, user),
# identical non-php8.3 packages, the same set of php8.3 packages, identical
# installer, /app-sources, PHP, nginx and service files, and identical CLI and
# FPM module lists. It also runs php-fpm8.3 -t and a multipart upload.
